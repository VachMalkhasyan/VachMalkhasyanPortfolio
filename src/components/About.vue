            Iâ€™m a passionate full-stack JavaScript developer with a journey that began in 2021
             when I delved into programming independently. In 2022, I proudly graduated from 
             Relq Technology School, earning a certification to validate my skills.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
              I gained
              hands-on experience working on Upwork for 10 months, focusing on React. Later,
               I spent 9 months at YogurtTeam as a Full Stack Developer, utilizing a diverse 
               tech stack including React, Nest, Next, Vue, Laravel, and both SQL and NoSQL
                databases. Excited to bring my expertise and enthusiasm to new challenges!

            I'm a student at ASUE, and my original major is finance. However, I've been transitioning 
            to the IT sphere because I didn't find myself enjoying the traditional finance role. My 
            aspiration is to combine my financial knowledge with my IT expertise to develop innovative
             products that will have a significant impact. I'm confident that both finance and IT will
              remain relevant and in high demand for the foreseeable future.
